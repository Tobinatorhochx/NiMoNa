# A relatively unfinished version. As of right now, all populations are reaching pretty much the same stable state. I tried 
# to make easy changes to that by bumping up the multiplicator for the doves and lowering the multiplicator for the hawks, but all I reached was
# that the population reaches a level that isnÂ´t normed to 1 anymore. The population of the doves is still at zero, which is unfortunate for #
# them.
